## Employee Attrition Analysis - Advanced Data Analytics Course Project

### Project Overview

This project is part of an advanced data analytics course aimed at understanding business scenarios and solving problems using data analytics. In this project, we focus on Salifort Motors' HR department, which aims to improve employee satisfaction levels and reduce turnover by analyzing employee data and predicting attrition.
Business Scenario

The HR department at Salifort Motors is concerned about employee satisfaction and retention. High turnover rates can be costly due to the time and resources needed for recruiting, interviewing, and training new employees. Therefore, they have collected extensive data on their employees and seek data-driven insights and suggestions to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.
Key Business Question

### What factors are likely to make an employee leave the company?

To address this question, we aim to analyze the collected data and build a predictive model that identifies employees who are likely to leave the company. By doing so, we can help the HR department identify and address the key factors contributing to employee turnover.
